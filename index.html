<brk>
<h2 style="background-color:#C1121F;">By William Lisle Bowles</h2>
<p>How cheerful in the winterR's night,<br>
As down the lane I stray;<br>The blacksmith's forge shoots out its light,<br>
And shines across the way!</p>
<p>The smith his laboring bellows blows,<br>
And now his stroke repeats;<br>
Beats the red iron, as it glows,<br>
And shapes it as he beats.</p>
<p>While, flash! the frequent sparkles fly,<br>
And tongs are hissing red;<br>
Content and cheerful industry<br>
Sweeten his daily bread.</p>
